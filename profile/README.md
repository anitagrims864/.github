Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with a strong background in full-stack development. Over the years, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and technologies, allowing me to build efficient and scalable applications. My expertise lies primarily in JavaScript and Python, but I am also proficient in Java, C#, and Ruby.

I have extensive experience working with modern web technologies, including React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. My approach to development emphasizes collaboration and clean code, ensuring that projects are maintainable and easy to understand. I thrive in agile environments where I can contribute to all phases of the software development lifecycle, from planning and designing to implementation and testing.

In addition to my professional work, I am deeply interested in open-source projects and the technologies that drive them. I love engaging with the community and continuously learning from others. You can often find me exploring new frameworks, tools, and methodologies.

Here are some of my pinned repositories that showcase my skills and projects:

- [Project Tracker](https://github.com/anitagrims864/project-tracker): A full-stack application for managing projects with user authentication and real-time collaboration features.
- [Personal Blog](https://github.com/anitagrims864/personal-blog): A simple yet elegant blogging platform built with React and Node.js, featuring a rich text editor and comment system.
- [Weather App](https://github.com/anitagrims864/weather-app): A weather forecasting application that consumes data from external APIs and provides a user-friendly interface.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to local tech meetups, participating in hackathons, and exploring new technologies through personal projects. Feel free to check out my repositories and let's connect!
